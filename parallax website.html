            </div>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is a sport in which the players fly in the air using paragliders. These paragliders are
                 light in weight and are foot launched. There is a harness in the glider on which the paraglider sits. This harness 
                 is interconnected to the glider with baffled cells. We will learn various aspects of this adventurous in the chapters that 
                 follow. Paragliding demands jumping from high heels and to ski in the air for long hours. Therefore, a hill station having 
                 a stiff peak and a wide area for surfing in the air will be a suitable environment.
                <br> <br>
                To compete in this sport, the player must have adequate license for paragliding and all other related documents 
                present with him before the competition. The distance covered by the player is transformed into points through computer 
                in IGC format.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Surfing is the sport of riding waves in an upright or prone position. Surfers catch the ocean, river,
                 or man-made waves and glide across the surface of the water until they break and lose their energy. In the ocean,
                  wave riders stand up on surfboards and navigate the water - nearly parallel to the beach - toward the shore.There 
                  are four types of surfing waves: spilling waves, plunging waves, surging waves, and collapsing waves.The ultimate goal 
                  of surfing is to ride and progress on the unbroken part of the wave using a surfboard.
                <br> <br>
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the 
                forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable
                 for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes,
                  in rive11rs in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
